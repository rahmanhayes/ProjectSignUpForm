# Project Sign Up Form
Sign Up Form Project


Focus on creating a single sign-up form for a website front end. The website itself doesn't need to influence the design here. Create something generic (yet original) that can be applied to any site at a later date.

Create a sign-up form using basic information like name, address, email, date of birth, and so on. Try to include a variety of elements - check boxes, drop down menus and input fields, etc. - and design a clean set of icons that you can use to represent each section. A sign-up form is an important point of engagement between user and site, so the way they look and function is really important.
